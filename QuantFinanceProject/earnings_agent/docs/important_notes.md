- SWITCH TO NSE RSS FEEDS!!!!!!!!! - IMPORTANT
- IMPORTANT CHANGE - DATABASE MIGRATIONS SETUP - move to this setup
- MOVE ingestion.nse_classification and the classification table and the company master table to the corporate_agent
- In the Company Master and classifications table - make it source agnostic, and there are two types of changes - when the classification itself changes (the source file) and when the individual companies themselves change. Make it fully indempotent as well - update only on change. 
- build an auto suggestion engine to improve the semantic mapping iteratively 
- Important - right now in reconciliation_playbook.yml, the thresholds that govern the differences in each "cheap" source in the validation engine are hard coded, eventually we would have to transition to a method where we use dynamic updating of the thresholds for checking for suspicious values. there would be a dynamic updating logic for each ticker * metric to compare sources and determine the thresholds. 
- Important - make the cross source reconciliation a much 'smarter' process, right now its hardcoded, but then it should be made a smarter process. 
- Important - In the balance sheet and cash flow statement and whatever else is not released every quarter (for instnace balance sheet and cash flow are only released half yearly), we would have the issue of quarterly data missing in that quarter, so we can reconcile data from this quarter and carry forward data for the missing metrics from the last quarter and then have a metadata layer in the final quarterly fundamentals + KPI tables, where we store a flag to store whether the status is "AS Reported" or "LOCF - Last observation carried forward" tag to say that particular data point was from the previous quarter, and also store the reported date to show when that data point was from 
- Instead of symlinking all the taxonomy packages, use Arelle Plugins or something more optimal for performance and scalability in the xbrl parser.
